# isA_Docs — Product Requirements Document

> **Product**: isA Developer Documentation Platform
> **Type**: Developer-facing documentation site (like docs.anthropic.com, platform.openai.com/docs)
> **Owner**: isA Platform Team
> **Repo**: `xenoISA/isA_Docs`
> **Created**: 2026-03-03
> **Last Updated**: 2026-03-03

## 1. Product Vision

isA_Docs is the **public developer portal** for the isA platform. It is not an internal project wiki — it is a product that developers use to evaluate, adopt, and build with isA services. Every page is a touchpoint that either builds or erodes developer trust.

**North Star**: A developer can go from "what is isA?" to a working agent in under 10 minutes using only the docs.

**Competitive set**: Anthropic Docs, OpenAI Platform Docs, Stripe Docs, Vercel Docs.

## 2. Target Users

| Persona | Goal | Key Pages |
|---------|------|-----------|
| **Evaluator** | Assess if isA fits their needs | Home, Architecture, FAQ, Playground |
| **Builder** | Build agents and integrations | Agent SDK, MCP, Model, Getting Started, Cookbook |
| **Operator** | Deploy and monitor in production | Cloud, OS, User Services, Deployment Guide |
| **Contributor** | Extend the platform | API Reference, CDD contracts, GitHub |

## 5. Current Phase: Developer-Grade DX Overhaul

### 5.1 Problem Statement

A product audit (2026-03-03) against the implementation revealed 13 gaps across accuracy, completeness, and interactive components. The docs read like maintained project notes rather than a developer product. Key trust-breakers:

- **Contradictory numbers**: MCP tool count says "89+" in 10 places but "190+" in the Agent SDK tools page
- **Wrong model names**: 3 pages reference `gpt-5-nano` while 40+ pages use `gpt-4.1-nano`
- **Mocked components**: StatusBadge always returns "operational"; FeedbackWidget logs to console
- **Missing projects**: isA_Mate and isA_Orch have zero documentation
- **Unresolved placeholders**: 5+ "Coming Soon" sections across the site

### 5.2 Requirements

#### 5.2.1 Content Accuracy (P1)

**Requirement**: Every number, model name, and API example in the docs must be correct and consistent across all pages.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] Single authoritative MCP tool count used everywhere (verify against `isA_MCP` source)
- [ ] Single authoritative default model name used everywhere (verify against `isA_Model` source)
- [ ] Tool names follow a documented capitalization convention (snake_case for MCP tools, PascalCase only for Claude Code tool references)
- [ ] Zero conflicting numbers or names across all 95 MDX files

**Stories**:
- Fix MCP tool count to single authoritative number across all pages (P1)
- Fix model name inconsistency — standardize gpt-5-nano vs gpt-4.1-nano (P1)
- Standardize tool name capitalization convention (P2)

#### 5.2.2 Platform Coverage (P2)

**Requirement**: Every isA project listed in the platform directory must have at minimum an index page with overview, architecture diagram, quick start, and tech stack.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] `content/mate/index.mdx` exists with overview, architecture, getting-started
- [ ] `content/orch/index.mdx` exists with overview, architecture, getting-started
- [ ] Home page and architecture page reference all 16 projects

**Stories**:
- Add isA_Mate project documentation (P2)
- Add isA_Orch project documentation (P2)

#### 5.2.3 Interactive Components (P2)

**Requirement**: Every interactive component on the site must be functional — no mocked behaviors in production.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] StatusBadge either fetches real status or displays static badge without fake fetch
- [ ] FeedbackWidget submits to an endpoint or is removed from rendered pages
- [ ] Search API has rate limiting (30 req/min/IP), configurable embedding model, 10s timeout
- [ ] Search API embedding model is env-configurable (not hardcoded `text-embedding-3-small`)

**Stories**:
- Fix StatusBadge — remove mock, use real status or static display (P2)
- Harden search API — rate limiting, timeouts, configurable model (P2)
- Wire FeedbackWidget to backend or remove from pages (P3)

#### 5.2.4 Placeholder Resolution (P2)

**Requirement**: No "Coming Soon" text without a linked tracking issue or concrete timeline.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] `content/platform/index.mdx` "Coming Soon" section either documented or linked to issue
- [ ] `content/agents/creative.mdx` "Coming Soon" section resolved
- [ ] `content/agent-sdk/desktop-execution.mdx` cloud_pool reference resolved
- [ ] `content/faq.mdx` pricing and compliance "coming soon" items resolved
- [ ] `content/os/python-repl.mdx` architecture diagram `(TODO)` replaced

**Stories**:
- Resolve all "Coming Soon" placeholders across docs (P2)
- Fix Python REPL TODO in architecture diagram (P3)

### 5.3 Out of Scope (This Phase)

These are valuable but deferred to a future phase:

| Feature | Rationale |
|---------|-----------|
| Multi-language SDK parity (Python + JS + cURL on every page) | High effort, requires coordinating with SDK teams |
| Live API playground with real backend calls | Requires auth infrastructure for anonymous users |
| Automated docs generation from source code | Separate tooling initiative |
| Status page with historical uptime | Needs dedicated monitoring infrastructure |
| i18n / localization | Not needed at current scale |
| AI-powered search answers (RAG over docs) | Current vector search is functional; full RAG is a future enhancement |
| Developer onboarding analytics / funnel tracking | Needs analytics infrastructure first |

---

## 6. Phase 3: Production Readiness (Epic #31)

### 6.0 Problem Statement

A production readiness investigation (2026-03-05) found that the docs site builds cleanly (118 static pages) but has **no deployment path, no CI, no tests, and several API/component issues** that would prevent a reliable production deployment. The site works locally but is not production-grade.

### 6.1 Deployment & CI (P0-P1)

**Requirement**: The site must have a defined, repeatable deployment path and automated quality gates.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] Dockerfile or Vercel config exists and produces a working deployment
- [ ] GitHub Actions CI runs build + lint on every PR
- [ ] ESLint and Prettier are configured with standard Next.js rules

**Stories**:
- Add deployment configuration — Dockerfile + container/Vercel config (P0, infra)
- Add GitHub Actions CI pipeline — build + lint on PR (P1, infra)
- Add ESLint + Prettier configuration (P1, infra)

### 6.2 API Hardening (P0-P1)

**Requirement**: Server-side API routes must be durable, observable, and resilient in production environments.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] Feedback storage uses a durable backend (not local filesystem)
- [ ] Rate limiter works across instances and survives restarts (Redis or external)
- [ ] Search API has health checks; UI degrades gracefully when search is unavailable
- [ ] Search input is debounced (300ms minimum)

**Stories**:
- Replace feedback JSONL file storage with durable backend (P0, api/data)
- Replace in-memory rate limiter with Redis or external solution (P0, api/infra)
- Add search health check and graceful UI degradation (P1, api/ui)
- Add debounce to AI search input — 300ms (P1, ui)

### 6.3 Code Quality & DX (P1-P2)

**Requirement**: The codebase must have type safety, test coverage, error resilience, and SEO basics for a public-facing site.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] TypeScript strict mode enabled with zero type errors
- [ ] Test suite exists covering API routes and key utilities
- [ ] React error boundaries wrap all interactive components
- [ ] No `console.error` in production code
- [ ] sitemap.xml and robots.txt are generated at build time
- [ ] Custom 404 page exists
- [ ] ApiPlayground proxies requests server-side (no client-side API keys)

**Stories**:
- Enable TypeScript strict mode and fix type errors (P1, core)
- Add basic test suite — unit + API route tests (P1, core)
- Add React error boundaries around interactive components (P2, ui)
- Replace console.error with structured logger or remove (P2, core)
- Add sitemap.xml and robots.txt generation (P2, docs/infra)
- Add custom 404 page (P2, ui)
- Add server-side proxy for ApiPlayground requests (P2, api)

### 6.4 Out of Scope (This Phase)

| Feature | Rationale |
|---------|-----------|
| Full monitoring/alerting | Requires dedicated observability infrastructure |
| CDN configuration | Depends on hosting decision |
| Production secrets management | Handled by isA_Cloud |
| Lighthouse performance audit | Separate optimization pass |
| Load testing | Premature before deployment target is defined |

## 7. Phase 4: Content Sync — Q1 2026 Platform Status

### 7.0 Problem Statement

A discovery audit (2026-03-12) compared documentation against actual project activity over the last 3 months (Dec 2025 – Mar 2026). Across the platform, **1,000+ commits landed** but documentation lagged behind. Two active projects (Creative: 36 commits, Marketing: 32 commits) have **zero documentation**. Several core projects shipped major features (Model fine-tuning, MCP health persistence, Trade approval gates) that are completely undocumented. The changelog's "Unreleased" section is missing work from 13+ projects.

### 7.1 Batch 1: Critical Gaps (P0-P1)

**Requirement**: Every active isA project must have at minimum a documentation page. Safety-critical features must be documented. The changelog must reflect shipped work.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] `content/creative/index.mdx` exists with overview, architecture, features, getting-started
- [ ] `content/marketing/index.mdx` exists with overview, architecture, features, getting-started
- [ ] Trade docs cover live trading approval gates, Risk Agent veto, circuit breakers
- [ ] Changelog "Unreleased" section includes work from all 13+ active projects
- [ ] Architecture diagram includes Creative, Marketing, and Orch
- [ ] Platform index lists Creative and Marketing under Products

**Stories**:
- Add isA_Creative project documentation (P0, docs)
- Add isA_Marketing project documentation (P0, docs)
- Document Trade live trading approval gates and risk management (P0, docs)
- Update changelog with all unreleased cross-project work (P0, docs)
- Update architecture diagram for Creative, Marketing, Orch (P1, docs)
- Update platform index to list Creative and Marketing (P1, docs)

### 7.2 Batch 2: Feature Documentation (P1)

**Requirement**: Major shipped features across core projects must have documentation matching their implementation.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] Model docs cover fine-tuning pipeline (LoRA SFT, dataset upload, checkpoint registry, Ollama deploy)
- [ ] MCP reliability docs cover health failure persistence and connection event tracking
- [ ] Agent SDK docs cover OAuth transport and macOS Keychain credential management
- [ ] Trade docs cover Prometheus alerting rules and Locust load testing

**Stories**:
- Document Model fine-tuning pipeline — LoRA SFT, datasets, checkpoints, Ollama deploy (P1, docs)
- Document MCP health failure persistence and connection event tracking (P1, docs)
- Document Agent SDK OAuth transport and Keychain integration (P1, docs)
- Document Trade Prometheus alerts and load testing baseline (P1, docs)

### 7.3 Batch 3: Polish (P2)

**Requirement**: Secondary documentation gaps across supporting projects should be addressed.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] Model latency-aware routing includes percentile tracking and tuning guide
- [ ] Agent SDK A2A guide includes heartbeat streaming details
- [ ] Orch docs cover code index, cross-project search, impact analysis
- [ ] Cloud ops docs cover backup/restore, PDB templates, security scanning
- [ ] User Services ops docs cover Prometheus /metrics, graceful shutdown, circuit breakers

**Stories**:
- Enhance Model latency-aware routing documentation (P2, docs)
- Document Agent SDK heartbeat streaming in A2A guide (P2, docs)
- Update Orch docs with code index and cross-project search (P2, docs)
- Update Cloud operations docs with backup/restore and security scanning (P2, docs)
- Update User Services operations docs with Prometheus metrics and circuit breakers (P2, docs)

### 7.4 Out of Scope (This Phase)

| Feature | Rationale |
|---------|-----------|
| Full CDD contracts for Creative/Marketing | These are initial project pages, not full doc suites |
| Comprehensive Trade operations manual | Separate future phase — start with safety-critical docs |
| Automated changelog generation from commits | Separate tooling initiative |

### Phase 6: Interactive & Trust

- Live API playground with sandboxed backend
- Per-service status dashboard with uptime history
- AI-powered search with RAG (answer questions, not just find pages)
- Developer feedback pipeline (submit → triage → fix → notify)
- Community contributions workflow

### Phase 7: Scale

- Multi-language docs (JS/TS SDK parity)
- Auto-generated API reference from OpenAPI/protobuf specs
- Onboarding funnel analytics (where do developers drop off?)
