### Is isA open source?

Yes, isA is open source. You can find all repositories at [github.com/isA-platform](https://github.com/isA-platform).

### What models does isA support?

isA supports multiple LLM providers:

| Provider | Models |
|----------|--------|
| Anthropic | Claude claude-sonnet-4-20250514, Claude Opus, Claude Haiku |
| OpenAI | GPT-4o, GPT-4o-mini, GPT-4 Turbo |
| Google | Gemini Pro, Gemini Ultra |
| Local | Any Ollama-compatible model |

### How much does isA cost?

- **Self-hosted**: Free (you pay for infrastructure)
- **Cloud hosted**: Usage-based pricing (coming soon)

Model costs are passed through at provider rates.

## Agent SDK

### How do I install the SDK?

```bash
pip install isa-agent-sdk
```

### How do I create a simple agent?

```python
from isa_agent_sdk import Agent

agent = Agent(
    name="my-agent",
    model="claude-sonnet-4-20250514",
    tools=["web_search", "calculator"]
)

response = await agent.run("What is 2+2?")
```

### Can agents remember previous conversations?

Yes, use the memory feature:

```python
agent = Agent(
    name="my-agent",
    memory={"type": "persistent", "store": "redis"}
)
```

### How do I add custom tools?

```python
from isa_agent_sdk import tool

@tool
def my_custom_tool(query: str) -> str:
    """Search my database."""
    return database.search(query)

agent = Agent(tools=[my_custom_tool])
```

### Can I use multiple models in one agent?

Yes, use the router:

```python
agent = Agent(
    model={
        "router": "cost-optimized",
        "models": ["claude-sonnet-4-20250514", "gpt-4o-mini"]
    }
)
```

## MCP Tools

### What tools are available?

Over 50 tools across categories:

- **Search**: web_search, image_search, news_search
- **Files**: file_read, file_write, file_list, file_delete
- **Code**: code_interpreter, shell, git
- **Browser**: browser_navigate, browser_click, browser_screenshot
- **Database**: postgres_query, redis_get, neo4j_query
- **APIs**: http_request, graphql_query

See the [full tools list](/mcp/tools).

### How do I use a tool directly?

```python
from isa_mcp import tools

result = await tools.web_search("latest AI news")
```

### Can I create custom MCP tools?

Yes, see the [tool development guide](/mcp/development).

## Deployment

### What are the system requirements?

**Minimum (development)**:
- 4 CPU cores
- 8 GB RAM
- 50 GB disk

**Recommended (production)**:
- 8+ CPU cores
- 32+ GB RAM
- 200+ GB SSD
- Kubernetes cluster

### How do I deploy locally?

```bash
cd deployments/kubernetes/local/scripts
./kind-setup.sh
./kind-deploy.sh
```

### How do I deploy to production?

1. Set up a Kubernetes cluster (EKS, GKE, or self-managed)
2. Install ArgoCD
3. Connect your repository
4. Push to `main` branch

See the [deployment guide](/cloud/deployment).

### Can I use my own infrastructure?

Yes, isA is fully self-hostable. You can:

- Use your own Kubernetes cluster
- Bring your own databases
- Use your own model API keys

## Security

### How is data encrypted?

- **At rest**: AES-256 encryption
- **In transit**: TLS 1.3
- **Secrets**: Stored in Vault or AWS Secrets Manager

### How does authentication work?

isA uses JWT tokens for API authentication:

1. User authenticates via `/auth/login`
2. Receives JWT access token + refresh token
3. Include token in `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header
4. Token validated by APISIX gateway

### Is there RBAC support?

Yes, isA has fine-grained role-based access control:

- Organizations with multiple roles
- Resource-level permissions
- API scope restrictions

See [authentication docs](/user/authentication).

### Is isA SOC 2 compliant?

Self-hosted deployments inherit your compliance posture. Cloud-hosted (coming soon) will be SOC 2 Type II compliant.

## Troubleshooting

### Agent not responding?

1. Check your API key is set: `echo $ISA_API_KEY`
2. Verify model service is running
3. Check logs: `kubectl logs -l app=model-service`

### Tools not working?

1. Verify tool is installed: `isa tools list`
2. Check MCP service: `curl http://localhost:8301/health`
3. Review tool permissions

### Slow responses?

1. Enable caching in model service
2. Use streaming for long responses
3. Consider a faster model (e.g., `gpt-4o-mini`)

### Memory issues?

1. Clear old memories: `agent.memory.clear()`
2. Use memory limits: `memory={"max_items": 100}`
3. Check Redis memory: `redis-cli INFO memory`
