# isA Platform

Deploy and scale your AI agents in the cloud.

## Overview

The isA Platform provides infrastructure for deploying, managing, and scaling AI agents built with the Agent SDK.

## Key Features

### Code Deployment
Deploy your custom agents to production with a single command:

```bash
# Upload and deploy
tar -czf my-agent.tar.gz -C my-agent .
curl -X POST /api/v1/deployments/{id}/upload -F "file=@my-agent.tar.gz"
curl -X POST /api/v1/deployments/{id}/deploy
```

### Auto-Scaling
- Automatic scaling based on load
- Configurable min/max replicas
- Zero-downtime deployments

### Isolation & Security
- VM-level isolation for each execution
- Network isolation (no direct external access)
- Sandboxed tool execution

### Monitoring
- Real-time logs and metrics
- Health checking
- Alerting and notifications

## Architecture

```
User Request → API Gateway → Pool Manager → Cloud OS VM
                                           └─→ API Proxy → External Services
```

## Deployment Workflow

1. Create deployment configuration
2. Upload code (tar.gz or Git)
3. Automatic Docker image build
4. Deploy to Cloud OS VMs
5. Route traffic to your agent
