# Pre-built Agents

Ready-to-use AI agents built on the isA Agent SDK.

## Available Agents

| Agent | Description | Use Case |
|-------|-------------|----------|
| [**isA Vibe**](./vibe) | Coding assistant | Development, debugging, code review |
| [**isA Creative**](./creative) | Content creation | Writing, marketing, social media |
| [**isA Agent**](./default) | General purpose | Research, automation, assistance |

## Architecture

All agents are built using the same SDK and share:

- **Tool Access** - 50+ tools via MCP
- **Streaming** - Real-time responses
- **Human-in-the-Loop** - Approval workflows
- **Checkpointing** - Durable execution

## Build Your Own

Use any agent as a starting point:

```python
from isa_agent_sdk import query, ISAAgentOptions

options = ISAAgentOptions(
    skills=["your-custom-skill"],
    allowed_tools=["web_search", "read_file"]
)

async for msg in query("Your prompt", options=options):
    print(msg.content, end="")
```

See the [Agent SDK documentation](/agent-sdk) for details.
