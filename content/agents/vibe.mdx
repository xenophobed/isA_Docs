# isA Vibe

AI-SDLC orchestration assistant for building and operating software projects with CDD + TDD workflows.

## Overview

isA Vibe runs on top of `isa_agent_sdk` and is designed to work across project types (Python services, React apps, data projects), even when `config/vibe.yaml` is missing.

## Latest Updates (2026-02-14)

- **Generic project support** improved for any repo layout.
- **Backlog automation** expanded via CLI flows for backlog readiness, dispatch, status, and watch mode.
- **New security tools** added:
  - SAST scanning (`scan_project`, `scan_diff`, `scan_file`)
  - dependency vulnerability scanning (`scan_dependencies`)
- **New infrastructure tools** added:
  - cross-service log query / correlation
  - migration history / validate / upgrade / generate helpers
- **MCP cleanup** completed by moving core infra helpers to direct local tools for lower overhead.

## Core Capabilities

### AI-SDLC Workflow

- CDD documentation and contract generation
- TDD cycle execution and validation
- deployment and operations automation
- checkpointed orchestration with resumable sessions

### Backlog Workflows

- watch and dispatch backlog items
- route work to appropriate agent flows
- track workflow state and logs

### Security + Infra Assistance

- static security analysis
- dependency scanning
- environment/service log querying
- migration validation and upgrade support

## Quick Start

```bash
# Install
pip install isa-vibe

# Natural language run
isa-vibe "Generate CDD documentation for the auth module"

# Explicit run subcommand
isa-vibe run "Fix failing tests in payment service" --unit payment

# Backlog management
isa-vibe backlog ready --repo owner/repo
isa-vibe backlog dispatch --repo owner/repo
isa-vibe backlog --watch --repo owner/repo
```

## Example Configuration

```yaml
# config/vibe.yaml
project:
  name: my-project
  type: python

source:
  root: src
  pattern: "{component}"
  components: [auth, payment, user]
```

## Tooling Example

```python
from agents.tools import scan_project, search_logs, migration_validate

security_result = await scan_project("/path/to/repo")
log_result = await search_logs(service="auth", query="ERROR", limit=50)
migration_result = await migration_validate("/path/to/repo")
```
